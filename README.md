# Python 60 Day Challenge

Welcome to my Python 60 Day Challenge repository.  
This repository documents my journey of solving one Python problem every day to strengthen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of Python, and build consistent coding habits.

The goal is simple: learn by doing — every single day.

## Repository Structure

Each day’s folder contains:

- Problem Statement — Description of the challenge
- Solution — Python implementation with logic
- Concepts Used — Key programming ideas applied
- Output Examples — Sample runs (if applicable)

This structure keeps learning organized and easy to revisit.

---

## Objectives

- Practice Python consistently for 60 days
- Improve logical thinking and coding efficiency
- Strengthen fundamentals such as loops, conditions, and data handling
- Explore real-world inspired problem scenarios
- Build discipline and a strong coding routine

---

## How to Navigate

1. Open the folder for the specific day
2. Read the problem statement
3. Review the solution code
4. Run the program locally to experiment
5. Explore concepts used to reinforce learning

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python Libraries
- Command Line / Terminal

---
## Challenge Timeline

- Start Date: 28 January 2026  
- Target Completion: Day 60  

---

## Why This Challenge?

Consistency builds strong foundations.  
This challenge helps develop real coding confidence through daily practice, learning from mistakes, and gradually tackling more complex scenarios.

---

## Future Plans

- Add more advanced challenges
- Include test cases and edge case handling
- Improve code documentation
- Explore algorithms and data structures
- Share insights and lessons learned

---

## Contributions

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions, ideas, or feedback are always welcome.

## Concepts Covered (Day-wise)

### Day 1 — User Profile Validation System
- Input handling and string processing
- Conditional validation logic
- Basic data integrity checks
- Structured output formatting

### Day 2 — Smart ID & Credential Validator
- Lists for storing credentials
- Loop-based validation
- Conditional rule enforcement
- Logical filtering and error handling

### Day 3 — Student Performance Analyzer
- Lists for marks storage
- Iterative data processing
- Grade classification logic
- Performance analysis techniques
- Personalized bonuses:
  - 4-letter name bonus
  - Lucky digit (7) bonus
  - Special topper condition

### Day 4 — Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer
- Activity log analysis using lists
- Loop-driven evaluation
- Risk categorization (Low / Medium / High)
- Personalized filtering based on register number
- Removal tracking logic

### Day 5 — Emergency Resource Dispatch Analyzer
- Categorization of requests
